          <p>
             <!-- Replace with your content -->
            JavaScript was created in 10 days by Brendan Eich in 1995.
            It is the most popular programming language according to GitHub.
            JavaScript is not the same as Java; they are different programming languages.
            ECMAScript is the standardized specification for JavaScript.
            JavaScript is commonly used for web development, but it can also be used for server-side programming (Node.js).
            JavaScript is an event-driven language, making it ideal for building interactive web applications.
            The arrow function (=>) was introduced in ECMAScript 6 to simplify writing anonymous functions.

            <!-- Replace with your content -->
            Navigation tabs are a common UI element used for organizing and switching between different sections or content on a webpage.
            They improve user experience and help users find information quickly.
            Tabs should have clear and descriptive labels to help users understand their purpose.
            You can use CSS to style tabs, such as changing colors and hover effects.
            JavaScript can be used to make tabs interactive by showing/hiding content based on user clicks.
